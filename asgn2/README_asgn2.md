- I used an llm (chatgpt) to code most of the basic structure of the assignment. I still had to manually revivew the code to fix bugs and tediously tweak some of the parameters as it didn't quite get it to where I wanted it. 

- I also asked chatgpt to add a few more features like adding "pitch" (another rotation axis) instead of just the one "global rotation" (yaw) as one I think seeing the peacock from different angles is kinda cool and that implementing it is also cool.
